### How the guide was created

This guide was built upon the structure created by [Patrick Marsceill](https://github.com/pmarsceill), specifically from the repository [just-the-docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs). The ‘just-the-docs’ format is a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) that transforms markdown to HTML to make a simple, and and good looking webpage.

Markdown through the use of Jekyll was used to form the structure and content for our myBCIT Navigation guide located on our Github website.
