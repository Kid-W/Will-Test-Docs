# Updating Your Personal Information
{: .no_toc }

This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to navigate the [myBCIT Homepage](https://my.bcit.ca/) to update your personal information, reset your password, or create/update your security questions.

You may need to update your personal information if you’ve moved, or if there are any incorrect fields. Attributes such as your name, citizenship status, contact/emergency contact information, and your educational credentials can be accessed and updated. If you’ve forgotten your password/security question, or simply want to change them, this guide will show you how to.
