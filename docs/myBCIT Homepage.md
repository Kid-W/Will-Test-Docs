## Overview of Pages

The homepage is a collection of links to the various resources available to you as a student as well as serves as the main hub from which students will contact faculty, staff and peers through Email. The myBCIT column on the left hand side of the webpage with the heading “myBCIT” offers quick access to some of the more notable resources such as your currently enrolled courses, the student resources page. The other important section on the myBCIT home page is the section titled “Online Self Service” on the right hand side of the webpage, which contains the majority of information and resources specifically offered to students through the myBCIT website.
